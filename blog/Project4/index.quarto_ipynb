Their marketing team would like to make the claim that patent applicants using Blueprinty's software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved. Ideal data to study such an effect might include the success rate of patent applications before using Blueprinty's software and after using it. Unfortunately, such data is not available. \n",

The data include each firm's number of patents awarded over the last 5 years, regional location, age since incorporation, and whether or not the firm uses Blueprinty's software. The marketing team would like to use this data to make the claim that firms using Blueprinty's software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved.\n",

        "This section conducts preliminary observations through EDA, with the aim of comparing the differences in patent output between companies using Blueprinty software and non-users. As can be seen from the chart, the proportion of Blueprinty users in the high patent number range is relatively high, and the overall patent performance is also more outstanding. Comparison of the average number of patents further shows that Blueprinty customers perform significantly better than non-customers. These preliminary results suggest that Blueprinty software may have a positive impact on patent applications, providing reasonable motivation and direction for the subsequent establishment of more rigorous statistical models."

        "### Model Interpretation\n",
        "In this analysis, we used a Poisson regression model to predict the number of Airbnb reviews, treating review count as a proxy for bookings. The model included predictors such as price, instant bookability, review scores, and property features. Because Poisson regression coefficients are in log form, we exponentiate them (exp(β)) to interpret their impact as multiplicative effects on the expected number of reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key findings from the model are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Price (log-transformed)<br>\n",
        "The coefficient for log(price) is 0.135, with exp(β) = 1.14. This indicates that a one-unit increase in log price is associated with a 14% increase in expected review count, suggesting that higher-priced listings may gain more visibility or attract more interest.\n",
        "- Instant Bookable<br>\n",
        "The coefficient is 0.341, with exp(β) = 1.41. Listings that support instant booking are expected to receive 41% more reviews than those that do not, highlighting the importance of booking convenience in driving customer engagement.\n",
        "- Review Scores: Cleanliness<br>\n",
        "With a coefficient of 0.109 and exp(β) = 1.11, each one-point increase in cleanliness score corresponds to an 11% increase in expected review count, underscoring how important cleanliness is in guest satisfaction and feedback.\n",
        "- Review Scores: Location<br>\n",
        "The coefficient is -0.098, with exp(β) = 0.91, meaning that a higher location score is unexpectedly associated with fewer reviews. This may suggest that guests are less inclined to leave feedback when location expectations are already met, or it may reflect an unobserved confounder.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the model provides interpretable and statistically significant insights into the factors influencing review counts. These results support the idea that certain listing features—especially instant bookability and cleanliness—play a meaningful role in increasing engagement, and they can inform host strategy and platform design going forward.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis demonstrates how listing characteristics on Airbnb relate to the number of reviews, which we use as a proxy for booking activity. Through a series of exploratory data analysis steps and a Poisson regression model, we identified key factors that significantly influence review count.\n",
        "\n",
        "Among these, instant bookability, listing price, and cleanliness score emerge as the strongest predictors. Listings that allow instant booking are associated with a 41% increase in expected review count, highlighting the role of convenience in driving user engagement. Similarly, listings with higher prices and better cleanliness scores tend to receive more reviews, suggesting that both perceived quality and visibility may contribute to user response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, location score shows a negative relationship with review count. While counterintuitive, this may reflect a behavioral trend where guests are less likely to leave feedback when their expectations are met—or it could indicate unobserved variables influencing this dynamic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Taken together, the results confirm that certain listing features meaningfully shape guest behavior and can influence a listing’s success on the platform. These findings can guide hosts in optimizing their property features and booking settings, and may also inform Airbnb’s platform design and recommendation algorithms to enhance both host and guest experience."
